# Open-ALPR

Project using Open ALPR library, to process images that contains car plates, in order to retrieve the plate value.


This project is developed in java (server side), and android(client side).

The server side is the responsible for all image processing, while the client side will be used like an user interface, to take pictures and send them to server. 

Rest webservices, will be used to perform communication between client and server. 


At this point, the client side is incomplete, but all communications paths are already implemented.
